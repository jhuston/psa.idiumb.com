I have been in Colorado visiting my family for the last week.
Now I am sitting in a tube that is soaring over a dark landscape that I imagine looks somewhat like it does during the light hours, if light were not the defining factor of my being able to see what is down there.

I say tube, in place of airplane. I also refer to my current living space as "the tube". It is a different sort of tube than the one I currently occupy. my living tube is a wood paneled, short ceilinged storage having adventure of an attic space.

Tomorrow, I will go to pick up the keys to another space. Studio D. This will be my "space of most occupation" for the next two months. I intend to move a lot of stuff into that space, but for the first couple of days, I think I will bring nothing. except for the duck station, and the guitar that I built for my trip to Australia when I was 18.

The last time that I was in Colorado, I spent an evening in my Mom's car, with a laptop and an audio interface recording a trio of songs on the same guitar. I created a feedback loop using the headphone out from the audio interface plugged into the car stereo via a tape adapter, a microphone pointed at the guitar, and another microphone aimed at the speaker of the car stereo. I recorded the microphone that was capturing the sound of the car stereo speaker. I was able to achieve some nice bass drum sounds by banging on the steering wheel and turning the stereo up enough to surf the edge of feedback, effectively giving the steering wheel a sustained tone that had a pitch that was determined by the resonance of the feedback loop.

I am listening to "This Tape Is Full."

I am pondering the necessity of editing.

I am remembering being in my bedroom at the last house that I lived in, a pile of speakers surrounding me ( I think I have a photograph of a day close to that day )
I received a phone call from Izaak. I was telling him about the sweet sub-woofer that I had found on the street earlier. ( i subsequently found another sub-woofer, in the same neighborhood ).

There is a lot of noise on this tape. It was recorded with a tape recorder that I found on the street. With a stack of tapes.
