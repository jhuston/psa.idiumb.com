Something about the vastness of space that is both terrifying and compelling. The possibilities and the responsibilities. There is nothing that must happen, yet there is a feeling that something wants to happen, and that the space wants to be occupied. With activity, with stuff, with tools. 

Practice sensing space.  
Soften the gaze and walk around.  
Notice the way that everything moves in relation to everything else.  
You are a point of reference.  
Bring the trees inside.  
The things learned from long walks through the city.  
Bring those inside.  
Release what is inside out into this container.  
contents may be dead hot  
or something else.
