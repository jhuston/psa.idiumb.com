	<h2>CodedOval ::: Artifactuals</h2>
	<p><b>CodedOval ::: Artifactuals</b> is the title of Jeffrey Alan Huston's PROJECT: space available residency.</br>
		It is my intention to explore the process of creation, as well as the codification of emergent compositional elements, as they arise within the physical and emotional space of my time as a PROJECT: Space Available artist in residence.
